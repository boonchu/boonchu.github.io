###### It has been for while without any update :)
  * So, I started looking at my puppet code since I joined another company. I experiment with [firewall from puppetlabs and wsgi web service](https://github.com/boonchu/puppetlabs/tree/master/my_firewall)
  * I took the class from [fundramental of computing - Rice U coursera.org](https://github.com/boonchu/python3lab/tree/master/coursera.org), it was fun and enjoy coding in Python.
